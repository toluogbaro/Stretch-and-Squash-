# Introduction
Welcome to the **Stretch & Squash** github page.

Enter a new age of science in this co-op platformer adventure playing as Stretch and Squash, slime brought to life due to the meddling of the Royal Plasma Institution

Using their slimy attributes, the players must slip their way through challenging environmental puzzles by harnessing skills unique to one another and paying attention to their own limitations. Form the ultimate synergy to make the discovery of the century.

This project was produced using Unreal Engine (**Version 5.1**).
