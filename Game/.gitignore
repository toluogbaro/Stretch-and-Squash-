# This .gitignore goes back to the original Unreal Engine template we had in the GA from 2018-2022.
# It was made using toptal.com. The file is still accurate, so it hasn't been touched.

# If you are tempted to add the Platforms folder to the .gitignore, I wouldn't bother.
# It's a config folder that doesn't matter for most GA students and can be deleted usually.
# In UE 5.3 or 5.4 this will be fixed and unreal engine wont generate it unless you actually
# need the config files for your project.

# If someone adds Platforms to .gitignore it will be forgotten and someone in the future is going to
# have issues with their project because the config file wasn't committed to version control.
# This is why it's better to leave that folder out of .gitignore
